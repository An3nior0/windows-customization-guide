# Software
To start, you'll need to download these:

## Rainmeter
Basically allows you to put widgets on your desktop, but you can use it for some other stuff too.

## Wallpaper Engine

## Lively Wallpaper
> ⚠️ Free alternative to Wallpaper Engine

Same as Wallpaper Engine but free. Cons are that way less wallpapers are supported, and it's heavier on your system resources.
