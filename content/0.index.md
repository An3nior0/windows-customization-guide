# Hello!
Welcome to my **Windows Ricing Guide.** I tried my best to make it as comprehensible as possible. If you have any doubts, you can open an issue on the [GitHub](https://github.com/An3nior0/windows-customization-guide), and if you want to make any edits, make a pull request. The source of everything is at [content](https://github.com/An3nior0/windows-customization-guide/tree/main/content).

This guide will cover desktop and app customization.  Almost all of the software used in this guide is free. If it's not free, I'll provide free alternatives.
